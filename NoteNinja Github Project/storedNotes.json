["**Lesson Overview: Photosynthesis**", "**I. Definition**\n- Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converting light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy (glucose).", "**II. Key Concepts**\n- **Chlorophyll**: A green pigment in the chloroplasts of plant cells, essential for absorbing sunlight necessary for photosynthesis.\n- **Light-dependent Reactions**: Occur in thylakoid membranes where sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen.\n- **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)**: Taking place in the stroma of the chloroplast, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose using energy from light-dependent reactions.", "**III. Process Overview**\n- Photosynthesis consists of two main stages:\n  1. **Light-dependent Reactions**: Sunlight excites chlorophyll, leading to the splitting of water molecules and production of energy-rich compounds (ATP and NADPH).\n  2. **Calvin Cycle (Light-independent Reactions)**: ATP and NADPH from the first stage are used to transform carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of chemical reactions.", "**IV. Importance of Photosynthesis**\n- Photosynthesis is crucial for all life forms as it produces oxygen and forms the basis of the food chain. ", "**V. Notable Example**\n- Large trees like oaks can produce enough oxygen in one growing season to support two human beings for a year."]
